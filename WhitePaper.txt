Black box testing projects
Long lasting bullshit projects with 
- idiot Methods
- bloody managers
 -- CAPL
 -- Erlang
- fucking requirement manangement
- go into network drive to compile (one license too less)
- AKKA - > 
- indirect eployed ll-workrer quit before hardware exists
- idiot manager hat werkstatt abgeschafft

Goals: Have a black box testing projects from scratch

(+)
early start of programming before project hardware exists
everything is remote
home office all developers possible

checking of situations which is hard to force or simulate

less education problems 
use standard software

force to plan software development
(-)
force to plan software development
lot of more programming

(x)
hardware set generation/building at external company
possible monitoring of management quality

set building requires software planning
e.g. spi interface to monitoring battery temperature
definig this interface requires the information of battery matrix and which battery cell at what position has wich temperature channel
